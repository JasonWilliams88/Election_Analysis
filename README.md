# Election_Analysis
The following code was used to bring meaning to bulk election data that contained candidates, votes for that candidate, and the county the vote was cast in
We were able to return the following
* The voter turnout for each county
* The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
* The county with the highest turnout
